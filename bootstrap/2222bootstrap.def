# This definition represents both the 2^4 hypercube puzzle, and Melinda's 2x2x2x2 physical puzzle.   
# There are 16 pieces with 12 orientations each; all pieces share a single orbit of size 16.
# 
# The orientations aren't just scalars that add and commute.  Since our software can't handle orientations that act that way,
# we have flattened the puzzle into a big permutation of 64 sub-pieces called stickers.  There are 16 groups of 4, with each 
# group of 4 sticker positions corresponding to one piece position in the original puzzles.
#
# There are 8 sticker colors.  Each piece has one sticker from each pair R/O, W/Y, G/B, P/V, for a total of 2^4 = 16 combinations,
# with each piece having a unique combination.   
#
# The permutation of the 4 stickers within each piece determines its orientation.   Only half of the 4*3*2 = 24 possible permutations are used,
# because each puzzle piece only has one of the two handednesses (this is true for both the virtual and physical puzzles).
#
# The normal solved state is the identity:  (this is handy for converting ScrambleAlg's into new Move's)
# 1 2 3 4  5 6 7 8  9 10 11 12  13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20  21 22 23 24  25 26 27 28  29 30 31 32   33 34 35 36  37 38 39 40  41 42 43 44  45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52  53 54 55 56  57 58 59 60  61 62 63 64
#
# The color map for each sticker in the solved state is as follows:
# 1 2 3 4  1 2 8 3  1 2 7 8  1 2 4 7  1 6 4 3  1 6 3 8  1 6 8 7  1 6 7 4  5 2 3 8  5 2 4 3  5 2 7 4  5 2 8 7  5 6 8 3  5 6 3 4  5 6 4 7  5 6 7 8 
#
# 1  2  3  4    5  6  7  8    <-- color number in the above
# R  W  G  P    O  Y  B  V    <-- the sticker's color.  P = pink = #ffa0ff,  V = violet (more like plum, really) = #7f007f
#
# Alternatively to the identity 1-64, the solved position can be replaced with the color map above, if you're using software that supports duplicated pieces.
# You should get identical results and running times with either approach.
#
# This file, 2222bootstrap, has the three primitive moves that I had to hand-code:  Rx, Ry, and FOro.
#
# By processing the other "boot" scrambles and cut-and-pasting the positions resulting from each ScrambleAlg, the goal movesets can be produced.
